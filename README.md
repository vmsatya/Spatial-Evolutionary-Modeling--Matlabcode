# Spatial-Evolutionary-Modeling--Matlabcode

This Matlab code is used to examine the effect of spatially varying random micro-environment on invasion dynamics. Two different scenarios were considered for advantageous and neutral mutants.

Scenario 1: In the absence of migration of cells;

Probability distributions: Uniform

a) Stochastic modeling of Moran process with varying random fitness of mutants at each point on a Lattice. Matlab file: BRanProlif_UD.m is written for advantageous mutants. We can modify for neutral mutants too

b) Stochastic modeling of Moran process with varying random fitness of mutants, host cells at each point on a Lattice. Matlab file: ABRanProlif_UD.m is written for advantageous B mutants and neutral A cells. We can modify for neutral B mutants

Probability distributions: Bimodal

c) Stochastic modeling of Moran process with varying random fitness of mutants at each point on a Lattice. Matlab file: Bimodal25percentB.m is written for advantageous B mutants (with 25% rB=0.5 and 75% rB=1.5) and neutral A cells.

Scenario 2: In the presence of migration of cells;

Probability distributions: Uniform

d) Stochastic modeling of Moran process with varying random fitness of mutants at each point on a Lattice.
